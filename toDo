0. methods in esSolve should be broken up, and then test these individually

1. Implement own direct solver instead of linalg.solve?

2. Solver:
     Neumann BCs
     Poisson
     Parallelize / cython, http://wiki.scipy.org/PerformancePython

3. Iterative method:
     won't work if D[i][i] = 0, decide how to handle
     tol = tol/100.0 is temporary

4. Tests:
     use something like py.test instead
     Add tests that should fail? Fncs that don't obey Laplace eq
     passing of cosh*cos tests depends greatly on DX,DY,DZ. investgate further
