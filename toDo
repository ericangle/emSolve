0. add unit tests for individual methods in esSolve

1. Solver:
     Neumann BCs: a given boundary wall should allow for dirichlet and neumann points
     Poisson

2. Parallelize: CUDA, OpenMP / MPI
     http://wiki.scipy.org/PerformancePython

3. should test absolute in addition to relative tolerance
