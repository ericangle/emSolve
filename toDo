0. add unit tests for individual methods in esSolve

1. Poisson

2. Parallelize: CUDA, OpenMP / MPI
     http://wiki.scipy.org/PerformancePython

3. Should test absolute in addition to relative tolerance?

4. testLinAlg needs more test cases

5. Change system exits to raise exceptions instead

6. esSolve.py --> poisson.py ?

7. Switch BCs from E to dV/dx to make more generic?

8. Get final 2D and 3D test cases working

9. Figure out how to deal with all neumann bcs (user specifies V at point?), or throw error if a user attempts it

10. Make class for field? should be generic (not potential-specific), plot() method

11. Make more test functions for esSolve.electricFieldAtPoint()

12. Add unit test for particle::push()

13. Make example showing particle push

14. Once get poisson implemented, then need mechanism for particle to feedbackon field (deposit charge)
