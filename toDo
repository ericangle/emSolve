0. add unit tests for individual methods in esSolve

1. Poisson

2. Parallelize: CUDA, OpenMP / MPI
     http://wiki.scipy.org/PerformancePython

3. should test absolute in addition to relative tolerance?

4. testLinAlg needs more test cases

5. change system exits to raise exceptions instead

6. esSolve.py --> poisson.py ?

7. esSolve::applyBCs() --> make into a dictionary?

8. switch BCs from E to dV/dx to make more generic?

9. get 2D test case 4 passing

10. figure out how to deal with all neumann bcs, or throw error if a user attempts it

11. get 3d neumann working
