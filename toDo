0. add unit tests for individual methods in esSolve

1. Poisson

2. Parallelize: CUDA, OpenMP / MPI
     http://wiki.scipy.org/PerformancePython

3. should test absolute in addition to relative tolerance?

4. testLinAlg needs more test cases

5. change system exits to raise exceptions instead

6. esSolve.py --> poisson.py ?

7. make example that plots potential at each iteration (or every N iterations) to show convergence to solution

8. switch BCs from E to dV/dx to make more generic?

9. get final 2D and 3D test cases working

10. figure out how to deal with all neumann bcs (user specifies V at point?), or throw error if a user attempts it

11. make class for field? should be generic (not potential-specific), plot() method

12. make class for particles: pos, vel/momentum, charge, push() method
