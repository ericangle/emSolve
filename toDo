0. add unit tests for individual methods in esSolve

1. Implement own direct solver instead of linalg.solve?

2. Solver:
     Neumann BCs: a given boundary wall should allow for dirichlet and neumann points
     Poisson

3. Parallelize: CUDA, OpenMP / MPI
     http://wiki.scipy.org/PerformancePython

4. iterative: use absolute tolerance?
              gauss seidel

5. Tests:
     Add tests that should fail? Fncs that don't obey Laplace eq
     passing of cosh*cos tests depends greatly on DX,DY,DZ. investgate further
