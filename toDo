0. methods in esSolve should be broken up, and then test these individually?

1. esSolve assumes 2d means (x,y), 1d means (x) ?

2. Implement own direct solver instead of linalg.solve?

3. Solver:
     Neumann BCs
     Poisson
     Parallelize / cython, http://wiki.scipy.org/PerformancePython

4. iterative: use absolute tolerance?
              gauss seidel

5. Tests:
     not using X0, Y0, Z0
     Add tests that should fail? Fncs that don't obey Laplace eq
     passing of cosh*cos tests depends greatly on DX,DY,DZ. investgate further
